# DC-Project

### Conversion of Analog data to Digital signal:

•Two basic approaches:

1. Pulse coding modulation (PCM)

2. Delta modulation (DM)

•PCM involves the three basic steps:

1. Sampling -> PAM

2. Quantization

3. Line coding

### The second step of QUANTIZATION has been implemented here.

Here, levels has been fixed to 16 i.e. n=16; max and min amplitudes as V(min)=-40 and V(max)=40. This means the sample values lie in -40 to 40.

To try on different data, change values of n, V(max) and V(min) in the code.
